title: "Multivariate nonlinear chirp mode decomposition"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/SP2020
excerpt: 'In this paper, a novel Multivariate Nonlinear Chirp Mode Decomposition (MNCMD) is proposed. In contrast to most existing multivariate time-frequency decomposition approaches, the proposed MNCMD is capable of handling time-varying signal efficiently in an elegant variational optimization framework. The multivariate nonlinear chirp mode is defined based on the presence of a joint or common instantaneous frequency component among all channels of input signal. Then the objective function of MNCMD is defined as the sum of mode bandwidths across all signal channels. The alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed to optimize the MNCMD problem. MNCMD can extract an optimal set of multivariate modes and their corresponding instantaneous frequencies without requiring more user-defined parameters than the original NCMD. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed MNCMD are demonstrated by studying its mode-alignment, filter bank structure, quasi-orthogonality, the influence of channel number, noise robustness, and convergence. Specifically, we highlight the utility and superiority of the proposed method in three real-world applications, including the analysis of an oceanographic float position record (two-channel), the separation of α-rhythms in electroencephalogram (EEG) data (four-channel), and the detection of plant-wide oscillations in industrial control systems (nine-channel).'

In this paper, a novel Multivariate Nonlinear Chirp Mode Decomposition (MNCMD) is proposed. In contrast to most existing multivariate time-frequency decomposition approaches, the proposed MNCMD is capable of handling time-varying signal efficiently in an elegant variational optimization framework. The multivariate nonlinear chirp mode is defined based on the presence of a joint or common instantaneous frequency component among all channels of input signal. Then the objective function of MNCMD is defined as the sum of mode bandwidths across all signal channels. The alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed to optimize the MNCMD problem. MNCMD can extract an optimal set of multivariate modes and their corresponding instantaneous frequencies without requiring more user-defined parameters than the original NCMD. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed MNCMD are demonstrated by studying its mode-alignment, filter bank structure, quasi-orthogonality, the influence of channel number, noise robustness, and convergence.
