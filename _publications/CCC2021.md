title: "Median Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and its application to time-frequency analysis of industrial oscillations"
collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'Median ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD) represents a remarkable improvement based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method for alleviating the mode splitting and mode mixing problem. However, the single use of the median operator generates tough problems including the higher reconstruction error, and the presence of burr in decomposition products. Aiming at addressing these problems while catering to a better time-frequency representation of the industrial oscillations, a median complementary EEMD (MCEEMD) method is proposed in this paper. In this work, the median operator and the mean operator are skillfully combined during the ensemble process. Through the study on simulation and typical industrial oscillation case, the effectiveness of MCEEMD is verified compared with existing methods, including EEMD, CEEMD and MEEMD.'
