excerpt: 'Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) has received its wide application in low-grade waste heat recovery (WHR) technology for its significant performance and easy access to its components. Given the highly fluctuating nature of the waste heat source, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is usually utilized to realize the reasonable adjustment of ORC based WHR systems and has performed satisfactorily. In order to apply MPC, a relatively precise model should be built up for the ORC system which ensures acceptable control performance. However, popular modeling methods based on the mechanism of the ORC establish the high-dimensional nonlinear model and suffer from computational costs when utilizing complicated nonlinear MPC. Even if linear MPC is employed for the purpose of reducing the calculation amount, the model obtained by linearization near the operating points usually makes it valid locally, thus bringing about suboptimal or unstable control performance. To address this problem, the Koopman operator is introduced for the data-driven identification and MPC of the ORC system. Koopman identification constructs a linear model in the lifted space in which the ORC system possesses nearly global linear evolution and enables the prediction of the nonlinear ORC dynamics from measurement data. In view of the possible online calculation burden increment caused by the rise of variable dimension through lifting action, the fast Koopman MPC (FKMPC) algorithm is thus proposed based on the invariance of the Hessian matrix of the optimization problem to shorten the computing time. Simulations on setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection are performed to verify the established model accuracy and the control effectiveness of the proposed strategy in comparison with other approaches.'
