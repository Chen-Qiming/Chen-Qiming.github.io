title: "Detection and diagnosis of oscillations in process control by fast adaptive chirp mode decomposition"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/CEP2020
excerpt: 'Even though several algorithms have been proposed in the literature for oscillation detection and diagnosis, they can work reliably only for a specific type of oscillation and there is a lack of a common framework that accommodates the detection and diagnosis for various types of oscillations. To tackle this problem, an FACMD-based (fast adaptive chirp mode decomposition) detection and diagnosis framework is established in this study. It consists of two common oscillation detection indices and a novel strategy for diagnosing nonlinear and linear oscillations. Apart from detecting and diagnosing various single/multiple oscillations in single-input single-output (SISO) loop, FACMD can also distinguish the combination of linear or nonlinear oscillations and contribute to the root cause analysis for plant-wide oscillations. Finally, a series of simulations and industrial cases are used for testing. Compared with the existing work, the proposed methodology has better detection and diagnosis accuracy and a higher level of automation, especially in processing complex multiple oscillations.'
